# About the Project

A3GIS stands for Automatic Endpoint Ethics Enforcer on Generative Intelligent Systems.

This is a project aimed at providing a generative AI pipeline for automatically checking webpages about whether they adhere to common ethics or the law.

For users, we aim to provide a full generative AI experience: All you need to do is provide the webpage data and adjust various natural language prompts to get a report on the validity of the page. No coding or GPU resource required.

Currently we are developing the system based on ChatGLM model series by Tsinghua University.

Note: This will not be free because you need your own API access to ChatGLM. When we finally develop a UI for the system, maybe we will add support for other language models.
